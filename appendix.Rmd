## Equations

Although, in general, you will not be required to perform calculations by hand while following the tutorials found in this book, it is worth getting familiar with some key equations.

**Standard error of the mean (SEM)**

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\bar{x}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
(#eq:sem)
\end{equation}

where:

- $\sigma_{\bar{x}}$ refers standard deviation of the sample means indicated by $\bar{x}$.
- $n$ refers to the sample size.
- $\sigma$ refers to the population standard deviation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Z-test (**$\sigma$ is Known)

A test used to compare a sample mean with a population value when the standard deviation of the population ($\sigma$) is known and the sample size (n) is larger than 30.

\begin{equation}
\label{standard normal value}
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
(#eq:ztest)
\end{equation}

where:

- $\bar{x}$ refers to the sample mean.
- $\mu$ refers to the population mean.
- $\sigma$ refers to the population standard deviation.
- $n$ refers to the sample size.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**One-Sample t-test (**$\sigma$ is Unknown)

\begin{equation}
\label{testing a mean sigma unknown}(\#eq:t-test-one) 
t = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}
(#eq:onet)
\end{equation}

with $n-1$ degrees of freedom where:

- $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean.
- $\mu$ is the hypothesized population mean.
- $s$ is the sample standard deviation.
- $n$ is the number of observations in the sample.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Standard Deviation of Differences** - Two-Sample Test

\begin{equation}
s_{d} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(d - \bar{d})^2}{n - 1}}
(#eq:??)
\end{equation}

where:

- $\bar{d}$ is the mean of the difference between the paired or related observations.
- $s_{d}$ is the standard deviation of the differences between the paired or related observations.
- $n$ is the number of paired observations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Coefficient of Variation**

\begin{equation}
\text{CV} = \frac{s}{\bar{x}}(100)
  (#eq:binom)
\end{equation}

Note: multiplying by 100 converts the decimal to a percent

where:

- $s$ is the sample standard deviation.
- $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean.
