## Data set

We will use a modified version of the NFL Combine data set (ref needed). The data set can be downloaded from this link: https://osf.io/tbgfh/ 

Open the data set in JASP and proceed to answer the following questions:

## Questions

**Question 1**

For the variables `Heightin` and `Weightlbs`, create a table containing the following: `mean`, `median`, `standard deviation`, `min`, `max`, and `sample size` (n). This table will be called **Descriptive Statistics**.

In addition, ensure to filter the data so that only `Wide Receivers` (WR) and `Safety` (S) are include in the table.
