This book is comprised of step-by-step tutorials showing how to perform statistical analysis with JASP. Future versions of this book will contain topics related to hypothesis testing, descriptive and inferential statistics, etc. The goal is for this book to evolve into a textbook that may be used in Introductory Statistics courses taught at the undergraduate or graduate levels. Updates I announce major updates made to this book on Twitter. For updates, follow me at ofurtado3. Alternatively, you can subscribe to my blog www.drfurtado.us for updates. How to use this book To take full advantage of this book, I encourage you to download and install JASP (Section A.1.2). so that you can follow along. You will need to take some time to practice the tutorials using JASP. Besides, make sure to complete the challenge exercises you will encounter while studying the tutorials found throughout this book.

Below, you will learn how to download and install these applications in your machine. A.1 JASP The open-source statistical package JASP[1] will be used to demonstrate the statistical analyses covered in this book. A.1.1 Prerequisites Windows, MacOS, or Linux A.1.2 Download and installation Please, follow the instructions found in[2] to install JASP in your device.

Symbol Meaning Reference to a value in a n Sample size Sample \\(\\bar{x}\\) Sample mean Sample \\(\\mu\\) Population mean Population s Sample standard deviation Sample \\(\\sigma\\) Population standard deviation Population r Pearson correlation Sample \\(\\rho\\) Pearson correlation Population x, z Observed data value Population C.2 Equations Although, in general, you will not be required to perform calculations by hand while following the tutorials found in this book, it is worth getting familiar with some key equations. Standard error of the mean (SEM) \\[\\begin{equation} \\sigma_{\\bar{x}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\tag{C.1} \\end{equation}\\] where: \\(\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}\\) refers standard deviation of the sample means indicated by \\(\\bar{x}\\). \\(n\\) refers to the sample size. \\(\\sigma\\) refers to the population standard deviation. Z-test (\\(\\sigma\\) is Known) A test used to compare a sample mean with a population value when the standard deviation of the population (\\(\\sigma\\)) is known and the sample size (n) is larger than 30. \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{standard normal value} z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\tag{C.2} \\end{equation}\\] where: \\(\\bar{x}\\) refers to the sample mean. \\(\\mu\\) refers to the population mean. \\(\\sigma\\) refers to the population standard deviation. \\(n\\) refers to the sample size. One-Sample t-test (\\(\\sigma\\) is Unknown) \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{testing a mean sigma unknown}\\tag{C.3} t = \\frac{\\bar{x}-\\mu}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}} \\tag{C.4} \\end{equation}\\] with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom where: \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean. \\(\\mu\\) is the hypothesized population mean. \\(s\\) is the sample standard deviation. \\(n\\) is the number of observations in the sample. Standard Deviation of Differences - Two-Sample Test \\[\\begin{equation} s_{d} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(d - \\bar{d})^2}{n - 1}} (#eq:??) \\end{equation}\\] where: \\(\\bar{d}\\) is the mean of the difference between the paired or related observations. \\(s_{d}\\) is the standard deviation of the differences between the paired or related observations. \\(n\\) is the number of paired observations. Coefficient of Variation \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{CV} = \\frac{s}{\\bar{x}}(100) \\tag{C.5} \\end{equation}\\] Note: multiplying by 100 converts the decimal to a percent where: \\(s\\) is the sample standard deviation. \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean.
